    "# Gem Quality Control Workflow (\"huddle test\")\n",
    "Geophysicists test their sensors using \"huddle tests\", where multiple instruments are placed in a location, subjected to similar conditions, and checked to ensure they record similar signals. The terminal command `gem_verify_huddle_test` automates the process of comparing waveform, GPS, and state-of-health data among the instruments, resulting in a more accurate, comprehensive, and consistent evaluation of test results. \n",

    "- A high battery error for Gem #077. The battery voltage is too high, outside the Gem's operating range (1.7-15 V). It would be very unlikely for the Gem to operate at such a high battery voltage; rather, this should be interpreted that the battery sensor has a problem that must be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A2 and A3 errors for Gems #061 and #065. A2 and A3 are auxiliary analog inputs, which can be connected to analog sensors of the user's choice (e.g., external thermistors, snow depth sensors, absolute pressure sensors, etc.). The A2 and A3 results for these Gems are considered suspicious because of long periods with exactly zero change, which could be due to firmware bugs (as in this case) or short circuits.\n",

    "- Test 3-8 Gems at a time; fewer than 3 makes it hard to tell which Gem is wrong in a disagreement, and more than 8 is cumbersome. Ensure that all batteries have enough life that Gems will not drop out during the test. Start with empty memory cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Place all Gems in a place with GPS reception, in as small of a circle as possible, with barbs facing inwards. This helps ensure that they all record similar signals, even for short-wavelength signals due to turbulence/wind. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If needed, give the Gems time to equilibrate to the ambient temperature with lids open. Avoid testing them in sunlight, which could affect internal temperatures differently and trigger false errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start all Gems at about the same time, ideally within one minute. Before leaving them, check the LED codes to ensure they all get a GPS signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the Gems for around a couple hours to a couple days. Less than a couple hours can be insufficient to characterize their GPS performance. More than a couple days is cumbersome. Some infrasound event should occur during this period (doors closing work very well).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy the data to your computer and convert it, resulting in a folder structure as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visually inspect some waveform data (this task is difficult to automate) using a viewer like PQL or the `Stream.plot()` method in obspy. A high-pass filter of at least 1 Hz is generally needed to find events efficiently. Find an event that is highly coherent among the different Gems' traces. Data should agree in timing (down to 0.01 sec); this can be checked visually by zooming in on a high-frequency event (e.g., door slam) and filtering above 20 Hz. Additionally, data should agree in waveform shape and spectrum shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, run `gem_verify_huddle_test` as above, and check the report."
