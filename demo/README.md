# Gem Data Pre-Processing Workflow
September 28, 2020

### Installing the gemlog software (version 1.0.0 or higher)
You must have anaconda or miniconda installed to proceed. If you don't have either and don't know which to use, install miniconda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Then, follow the gemlog installation procedure [here](https://github.com/ajakef/gemlog/blob/main/README.md). Note that the resulting conda environment includes relevant packages like obspy and pandas.

### Getting Started
First, download the zip file in the list of files above; this contains the inputs for this demonstration. Move the file to some convenient folder, unzip it, and cd into the project folder.

Notice the structure of this project folder. It includes a “raw” folder where the gem data files go. You don't have to use the folder name “raw”--or even have a separate folder for the raw data files--but all the default settings assume you're doing it this way.
```
Project_Folder/
|__station_info.txt (table of SEED codes vs Gem serial number)
|__raw/ (raw data from all loggers, FROM THIS PROJECT ONLY)
```

This example includes six two-hour files from six data loggers.
```
$ ls raw
FILE0010.096
FILE0010.103
FILE0010.109
FILE0011.088
FILE0011.106
FILE0012.077
```
Gem data files have the Gem's serial number as the extension, meaning that we have data from Gems 077, 088, 096, 103, 106, and 109. Empty or nearly-empty data files (like those from quick tests between field campaigns) can cause problems in the data conversion. It's a good idea to start each field campaign with clean disks, and to inspect your raw files and remove bad files before converting them.

The optional file `station info.txt` is used to assign [SEED codes](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/seed/) (network, station, and location) to your output data. By default, your converted data will use the Gem serial number as the station name, and leave the network and location codes blank. If you want to assign different names, you need to include a comma-separated text file containing a table of serial numbers, network codes, station codes, and location codes. Because all Gem recordings are infrasound sampled at 100 Hz, they are automatically assigned the [channel code](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/seed-channel-naming/) HDF.

### Converting raw gem data
Set your conda environment to whatever you set up during the installation using a terminal command like `conda activate gem` and run the data conversion using the terminal command `gemconvert`. This may take a while to run if you have a lot of data! `gemconvert` will add the following folders to your directory structure:
```
Project_Folder/
|__station_info.txt (unchanged, and unused in this step)
|__raw/ (unchanged)
|__mseed/ (NEW: contains hour-long miniSEED waveform files)
|__metadata/ (NEW: contains csv files with state-of-health data)
|__gps/ (NEW: contains gps logs)
|__gemconvert_logfile.txt (NEW: contains a record of the conversion process and any messages)
```

By now, all the useful information has been extracted from the raw files; there is no reason to work with them further except for possible debugging. For more info on the gemconvert options and capabilities (e.g., the ability to write SAC files and the text format TSPAIR), run `gemconvert -h`.

##### Multiple conversion attempts
If the conversion is run multiple times, `gemconvert` will overwrite pre-existing miniSEED files. However, gps and metadata files are tagged with a conversion number at the end of their file name, so they are not overwritten. For a given Gem serial number, the file with the highest conversion number was created most recently. `gemconvert_logfile.txt `is appended to on each conversion attempt, so it is also not overwritten.

### Organizing the data
If your dataset is from an array or network, you probably want to create a station map and assign network, station, and location codes to your miniSEED files. You can do this using python functions from gemlog. Before starting python, you need a csv file assigning Gem serial numbers to network, station, and location codes.

In this example, `station_info.txt` describes a network (NM) containing two stations (LADR and MANZ), each containing three locations; each of the six Gem serial numbers is assigned to a network, station, and location. For more information on SEED codes, see [this IRIS page](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/seed/).
```
$ cat station_info.txt
077,NM,LADR,00
088,NM,LADR,01
103,NM,LADR,02
096,NM,MANZ,00
109,NM,MANZ,01
106,NM,MANZ,02
```
Begin by activating your conda environment as before: `conda activate gem` and open python within your project directory. Run the following code:
```
import gemlog
coords = gemlog.summarize_gps('gps', station_info = 'station_info.txt', output_file = 'project_coords.csv')
gemlog.rename_files('mseed/*', station_info = 'station_info.txt', output_dir = 'renamed_mseed')
```

The first command creates a new csv file containing the following columns:
* SN: Serial number
* lat: Latitude (degrees)
* lon: Longitude (degrees)
* lat SE: Standard Error of latitude (degrees)
* lon SE: Standard Error of longitude (degrees)
* t1: Time of first GPS sample (UTC)
* t2: Time of last GPS sample (UTC)
* num samples: Number of GPS fixes logged
* network: Network code
* station: Station code
* location: Location code
It saves the same information to variable `coords` as a pandas DataFrame. If the stationFile input (which assigns network, station, and location codes to each serial number) is not provided, the last three columns will be omitted. Note that although standard errors of latitude and longitude are reported, they are not totally valid measures of the location uncertainty due to likely correlated errors in the GPS points. Accuracy might be insufficient for beamforming with small arrays; consider a different means of surveying in such cases.

The second command reads each miniSEED file from the `mseed/` folder, assigns the corresponding network, station, and location codes, and writes it to the new folder `renamed mseed/`.

You can now create a basic station map using the following code. 
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(coords.lon, coords.lat, 'k.') # plot the lon and lat as black dots
## you may need to run plt.show() to see the plot, depending on your python interface
```
Finally, you can create an obspy 'Inventory' object and write it as a stationXML file using this code:
```
import obspy
from obspy.clients.nrl import NRL

## download the instrument response from the IRIS Nominal Response Library
nrl = NRL()
response = nrl.get_response(sensor_keys = ['Gem', 'Gem Infrasound Sensor v1.0'],
	   		    datalogger_keys = ['Gem', 'Gem Infrasound Logger v1.0',
			    '0 - 128000 counts/V']) # may cause warning--ok to ignore

## manually add elevation to 'coords'. raise an issue on github if you know an
## easy-to-install, cross-platform way to automate this!
coords['elevation'] = [1983, 1983, 1988, 1983, 1986, 1987] # from google earth

## create an inventory of all sensors used in this project--may cause warnings
inv = gemlog.make_gem_inventory('station_info.txt', coords, response)
inv.write('NM_inventory.xml', format='STATIONXML')
```
When validating the stationXML file using the [IRIS stationXML Validator](https://github.com/iris-edu/StationXML-Validator/), it should pass with no errors but probably with common warnings related to response units case.

### Inspect the Data
The following workflow can be used to read the renamed mseed data and deconvolve the instrument response.
Because wind noise is severe at lower frequencies, it is generally necessary to apply a high-pass filter to obtain good data; 1 Hz is a good corner frequency to start with. Obspy's plot functions do not handle long plotting periods well; a program like PASSCAL's PQL is probably better for perusing the data.
```
import obspy

## read the data
data = obspy.read('renamed_mseed/*')
print(data)

## combine traces so that each station has one trace
data.merge()
print(data)

## deconvolve the instrument responses using the inventory already created
inv = obspy.read_inventory('NM_inventory.xml')
data.remove_response(inv) # may cause warnings--ok to ignore

## filter data above 1 Hz (lower frequencies are often wind noise)
data.filter("highpass", freq=1.0)

## trim the data around a known event
t1 = obspy.UTCDateTime('2020-05-10T12:14:00')
t2 = obspy.UTCDateTime('2020-05-10T12:15:00')
data.trim(t1, t2)

## plot the results
data.plot()
```
